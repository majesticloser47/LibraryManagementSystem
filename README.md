OOPs project
Made a java project for sem3. Uploaded it late because why not?
Couldnt attacvh the databse I made for the books and stuff, but dont worry, its not a very hard job to make an sql databse. Just make sure you change the username and password in the ExecuteQuery.java file to whatever you set it to.
